Unknown 0:00
Though it's very different I mean I couldn't think of one

Unknown 0:08
for

Unknown 0:18
everyone and obviously we still get some quite big bills in those areas like

Unknown 0:31
you said you partnered with people like Ric yes the part of people by breakdown how are they supposed to reduce breakdown what does that mean? Well I don't speak for partners directly but I have to have I think they realise that things are changing and that's great to be on board with these types of services

Unknown 1:08
well they've worked with you to this point

Unknown 1:16
race to

Unknown 1:35
right Richard we

Unknown 1:46
have yeah

Unknown 2:06
challenge moving forward thought about product selling and selling to other companies I mean I think that we are

Unknown 2:30
trying to see where they're using a specific network of characters you know that they want to go revenue so, I'm sure there would be a product

Unknown 3:06
a number of fundraising

Unknown 3:12
parents which kind of raise your short term maybe thanks get them outside what are the key criterias for us we look for charity charity that we can go see directly

Unknown 3:38
proximately essentially, they provide support and opportunities for adults with learning disabilities. I've learned over the last few months of speaking with policies that there's a fair amount of support that young adults until they reach 80 to come step past 80 years old, really huge amounts and one of the masks that

Unknown 4:08
ended up getting some form

Unknown 4:24
ready to exit from the cafe with one find interesting interesting.

Unknown 4:59
It particular time after a few beers over the great identical yeah and the first time in December I realised at that point

Unknown 5:45
I may want to see if you can spare money

Unknown 6:13
alternative

Unknown 6:19
pretty shocked at the course of the year more

Unknown 6:28
explain To

Unknown 8:00
there's more humour

Unknown 8:06
sometimes like

Unknown 8:12
to surprise me to be one of the Wednesday talks

Unknown 8:19
now the same old guy comes in

Unknown 8:28
the door and out the door

Unknown 8:38
one of my co founders came to me and then like the first few minutes here like I'm gonna go with useless useless shit

Unknown 8:48
you get to actually help out with somebody

Unknown 8:53
right obviously I'm JB great to be you'll be better than a lot of photos of this guy

Unknown 9:17
well, there's no cover leading up to the Dragon's Den event and it has helped them and help us with financial plans. Also, the pitchers are using a schedule so you have to wait within business time so that's the festival March and they're gonna have an extensive course like five workshops. So they have let me see you

Unknown 10:00
to join one with

Unknown 10:09
three areas What do you need before you start going into software what's the first thing

Unknown 10:28
education solvency does

Unknown 10:55
right what do you think

Unknown 11:20
an app we implement NLP events trade shows the basic ideas just after 10 seconds to tell us who we're talking to natural language processors and compare the audio file and it's like a series so it's you it's

Unknown 11:49
your talking

Unknown 11:51
to us same thing

Unknown 11:53
okay talking to someone

Unknown 12:07
in the MDT

Unknown 12:12
experience even easier for the business people because

Unknown 12:23
that sounds like a four way conversation and understanding for people and 14 Does it work with LinkedIn? We want it

Unknown 12:43
on obviously after you say yes

Unknown 12:50
especially like you're sitting awkwardly say, oh come on even even better absorbed into a muscle conflict. scandal when it comes to commerce.

Unknown 13:19
Everything we played, I have to scan it just down this top this reading. But the other time do you record your voice, the opposite of your registration. And you can pay to get your friends to give

Unknown 13:39
up a cup of somebody

Unknown 13:41
you think is valuable. In other words, you can pay by minutes, and you can transfer. And the other aspect is, if you're an organiser, you can pay to get a summary data, which is like what topics are discussed and have always been sold on eyes. But we're trying to bring transparency to these events. It's like the mechanics of it's very archaic inside because like just like the person the person we're trying to make it more transparent for the organiser bring more benefits general

Unknown 14:14
never done would it be available it was obviously you got your phone in your pocket. So how would it pick

Unknown 14:26
your chest or you hold it or you can get eyes on your

Unknown 14:40
target check out we're trying to make it work. And that's why I'm here trying to get clients in Australia trying to gauge the demand you know

Unknown 14:56
then develops into maybe So you can actually put a black mirror in the show it could be

Unknown 15:14
9048

Unknown 15:17
But you know, you're talking to me that conversation has been recorded, you can bring back whatever summarise that conversation just because

Unknown 15:34
you don't need to use your memory

Unknown 15:37
same will be the just be like empty things like using our external memory for this for everything I was working for a Japanese company in Vietnam, and not a lot of activities and tradeshow and demanded business got I got to probably like, make an entire tree. Yeah, I was like based on however many conversations you know, and after you contact them, they start from scratch because they don't remember me either. You can put some conversation in context your face and the LinkedIn profile is supposed to be more that's more efficient. That's what it is that companies across company technologies resume logistics workers lives

Unknown 16:49
challenging problems and wanting to be able to communicate well with managing has given them feedback. But they don't have a way of doing that.

Unknown 17:11
even know who's talking? Who was given this?

Unknown 17:21
Without technology got many applications, like sitting in a classroom talking to a group, and the teacher has asked us to present nobody will notice because we're too shy to just get to see what's in the minds of the kids stuff like that. It could be because when you make this language NLP is so it's machine learning and existing services. That's why we work in these situations because it picks up the background noises picks up your voice because everyone's reporting on your phone you'll call a reporting refine to give you a very accurate reference to the conversation

Unknown 18:43
obviously we're not always the data protection tips on

Unknown 19:02
social media is exactly the same wireless tips are used in that way.

Unknown 19:12
Who is going to go to the Chinese government data storage company and the servers in China or the companies in China and therefore access that data? Is he talking about apologise in public in the hearings during the US, document like apologising to the parents

Unknown 19:46
we have to be careful as well. Some of the conversations my primary goal we have yeah We just need a bit more investment to get more people in the corresponding box so that's what I'm trying to do which I think is called

Unknown 20:22
to bring it to the big

Unknown 20:34
screen you are scattered

Unknown 20:49
around

Unknown 21:13
by I just want to add

Unknown 21:23
any events for your resolution documents and a lot of these events and Mark and Bristow

Unknown 21:31
I say I normally go to seven year

Unknown 21:49
old more ITT

Unknown 22:02
webinars

Unknown 22:37
gonna have

Unknown 22:43
never together and sometimes painful things you just have to take the

Unknown 22:58
voice in your head like I want to get to

Unknown 23:22
from Hong Kong runs a company

Unknown 23:27
and actually a co founder what we do is we use NLP is in these events and and what it would allow us to do is take our phones and tell us who we're talking to. So we don't have to scan QR codes especially these events so it was like a three way call. So commerce is a CRM we making the NVD right now we're basically about ready I think our beta is gonna finish maybe in April May

Unknown 24:08
one of these approaches so when's the wedding party next month, but then we've got when they

Unknown 24:22
look really cool. And the other aspect is for you the summary data, which is like what topics are discussed in the live and you can get into the nitty gritty details on what's discussed what we can also give you a transcript at least the partisans combine transcripts

Unknown 24:55
oh you would have got something about for me as well. So feel free to On LinkedIn let's go nowadays Why would a kid not email

Unknown 25:08
yeah

Unknown 25:11
he's the boss so you want to be

Unknown 25:18
like yeah i'll give you those tests right now

Unknown 25:39
I'm Seiko

Unknown 25:45
co founder for no reason or other medium businesses so essentially so

Unknown 26:10
yeah we're going to continue

Unknown 26:31
bye one else

Unknown 26:49
is alive oh yeah is it mainly focuses on living places

Unknown 27:12
have a lot of money is

Unknown 27:20
a waste to move up

Unknown 27:34
practice honestly

Unknown 27:44
you're interested in getting started or working on your site you can make it you might be using what do you guys think

Unknown 28:06
works like do you say hey Siri response isn't talking to you yeah it's always on likes you have the choice to get a chance to come to a trade shows or expo floor is actually about business is a bit more conversational there's no requirement for like

Unknown 28:35
just the directions say like you got your business owners and like a potential next employee and the type of job might want to try to refer back to it it's double sided. Yeah. And we can also provide provide data to the organisers that I want topics are discussed and stuff like that it's not always there but they definitely approach it already developed with three other co founders

Unknown 29:34
nobody's

Unknown 29:40
just a matter of timing. It's also like something like something recordings are made so they use that as well. Check that

Unknown 29:59
out Hey guys wait doesn't exist already knows

Unknown 30:34
like enjoy school

Unknown 30:45
but it's very difficult very difficult because they rely solely on the microphone Where are

Unknown 31:13
you told my mom that we

Unknown 31:28
come from a company not related to my job here I work for Japanese manufacturing and I deal with many trade shows that's how I came up with this idea

Unknown 31:53
were doing like a full year of science and AI well students the first thing I didn't even

Unknown 32:07
realise

Unknown 32:25
right about

Unknown 32:35
to show you

Unknown 32:41
does your company like obviously the most

Unknown 32:47
nobody would have in the house somebody like yourself goes away when I was when I was a lot younger maybe just a few months

Unknown 33:08
it has to

Unknown 33:15
donation

Unknown 33:37
you This is AWS C sharp

Unknown 34:14
different things like production lines

Unknown 34:23
like Damage check

Unknown 34:48
right

Unknown 34:59
day Hi I'm Seiko Jensen from Seiko Johnson I'm from Japan oh sorry founder of a startup we implement and obs and these these Mr. X dollars trade shows and every one of those gets really good so essentially the first and second stockings are going to tell us who we're talking about

Unknown 36:11
NLP so what's it like hearing it as you put the audio cue amongst a conversation and then they recommend when they recognise that we're in proximity and talking to each other it's

Unknown 36:29
fun I can judge

Unknown 36:35
these events were more sociable but in saying that suppose a trader was purely business is very very happy

Unknown 36:46
to say that I seem to have a pretty hard time now because it's like so big and stuff going on. And everyone's talking in their second language anyway, you can second language as well everyone. Everyone there is like I use it in French it's like it's a really stressful time to see see how that he pays for environment.

Unknown 37:19
And the second phase is to see which we can provide you with the transcript of the conversation with an administrator in person say you had a big business deal going on with this person. And if you can't remember about it, we can approach it to John's

Unknown 37:37
you know applications right? So anyways, I was just gonna say that's really cool

Unknown 37:51
you've got that

Unknown 38:01
you are you are you guys oh have you been here for so

Unknown 38:19
long? A missing company, draft but

Unknown 38:30
it's marketed towards organisers, lodges, corporate boards, these organisers, they can also get summary data what kind of options discussed obviously anonymized but the idea is often these events very archaic, you know, given to people who are trying to be more transparent and be able to get more value out of

Unknown 38:55
it especially how would you approach

Unknown 39:04
and how to download the free because

Unknown 39:12
that's how it works. The current any of the current and Opie's in public doesn't really work in these situations. Because we need every person recording to colleague and together to a better job description. That's how we weren't concerned about the privacy feels quite invasive.

Unknown 39:32
I thought had a way out. Because it is like to have that set up. Yeah. It's a very difficult thing. I don't say

Unknown 39:57
oh, yeah, no, he didn't. He wanted If

Unknown 40:17
I didn't have any sort of research and everything because I have thought carry on and I've been able

Unknown 40:33
to attend many such events obviously you know

Unknown 40:38
normally it's around downloads like learning things like that integrate with the technology we're learning to work by

Unknown 40:53
God's grace more hardware staff are trying to get permission

Unknown 41:31
right you want to stay optimistic

Unknown 42:04
the way down

Unknown 42:10
National Centre for Education

Unknown 42:27
a lot of work

Unknown 42:55
no in between but then me okay so

Unknown 43:26
never going anywhere you just have to provide a feeling but it's known for having

Unknown 43:52
a really nice

Unknown 44:37
you know what to do you

Unknown 44:44
take orders on sixth edition, be able to say I'm done

Unknown 44:55
most of my posts on Monday They're

Unknown 45:07
already just gone so to save time he was done with the base seems a bit silly but our sexual problem is

Unknown 45:20
fly drive most times when I take time as opposed

Unknown 45:37
to my car

Unknown 45:50
a brand new every

Unknown 46:04
possibility would be prepared to work like you can kind of use Linux laptop that's going to be worth the

Unknown 46:23
rest of my life I wish

Unknown 46:29
I could say before they come all the way

Unknown 46:41
to the track of who I am

Unknown 47:00
started startups Kool Aid businesses

Unknown 47:15
the basic idea is in the Mediterranean that's the basic reason someone dies

Unknown 47:28
everyone get totally like NFC to be like

Unknown 47:40
random

Unknown 47:59
what's the financial model

Unknown 48:12
depending on the size or the size of the event obviously first plan would be to get a summary. The second factor the second option would be to pay for everyone

Unknown 48:26
unless the organisers paid for you to say an expo we talked about this business idea whatever you choose to buy the transcript off and go back

Unknown 48:44
I had a scenario this week where I wanted to transfer that drive to Wales and I really want to have a summary of that in summary there's other people who run models when reading Max

Unknown 49:13
oh what's gonna look at

Unknown 49:27
your phones and tell you okay, you can use NLP is an organisation and these events

Unknown 49:34
are neuro linguistic programming language

Unknown 49:37
to create a model of my voice

Unknown 49:40
to recognise the voice of Steven. And the reason proximity I'm telling you that

Unknown 49:46
Why are you not convincing with LinkedIn from from using a voice

Unknown 49:54
that just goes on everyone's just like you have to talk to that person.

Unknown 49:58
Yeah, Okay nice so you guys working let's go

Unknown 50:11
to university enterprise programme working with no

Unknown 50:26
doubt by fulfilled and when in house climbing times okay cool Zeki transport I've left them as well now and so I have like multiple different things at the same time

Unknown 51:02
a lot of stuff ready to graduate

Unknown 51:14
to actually challenge a

Unknown 51:22
lot of engineers

Unknown 51:29
yeah so you got to

Unknown 51:50
because I always wanted to pull up the

Unknown 52:01
product to show my my CTO like likely

Unknown 52:16
that they will have to get some one of their suppliers which is basically this is

Unknown 52:33
one of the reasons why shutdown actually ran just the logistics maybe

Unknown 53:00
I'm chatting Horace I was managing

Unknown 53:06
money manager investment wanting to get

Unknown 53:10
and they were like well talk schedule these people

Unknown 53:21
we grow

Unknown 53:30
the team just three people look yeah I get the

Unknown 53:49
two days a week for money yeah strange. I haven't heard of any companies have also been involved

Unknown 54:07
which is somewhat accessible

Unknown 54:15
you gotta get like boxing something from the city centre. Like how

Unknown 54:32
right now as we speak wants me to talk

Unknown 54:43
about you. Because talks about they just say this is the funny even though we're making people

Unknown 55:05
just get over

Unknown 55:07
like this like a struggle

Unknown 55:14
like when you're at a conference talking my face and she always gets them to come join us time sheets come in and as they say like wash you like Pac Man

Unknown 55:35
What do you do well we

Unknown 55:44
had the chance

Unknown 55:46
we're using some off the shelf software

Unknown 55:57
libraries

Unknown 56:06
we have a mortgage

Unknown 56:28
all educators I think that's what's good about students

Unknown 56:42
songs No we haven't okay

Unknown 57:05
on making together

Unknown 57:25
Morning Good luck to you

Unknown 57:32
yeah

Unknown 57:36
yeah

Unknown 57:43
20 years

Unknown 57:48
we have many aspects

Unknown 57:57
many aspects What do you want well it's enter in the mandatory download transcript is

Unknown 58:17
only available

Unknown 58:24
at rest on your sites to production

Unknown 58:29
and also we also say that the statements you make are

Unknown 58:37
wrong models and like in a noisy environment once you get once you're ready to release

Unknown 58:52
we're just trying to grow

Unknown 58:54
yeah we

Unknown 59:05
can have as many of these bands Wi Fi is available activity

Unknown 59:28
forecasting last one offline

Unknown 59:35
talk on your device

Unknown 59:49
that will actually have aI capabilities built in like some GPU CPU and then can help

Unknown 1:00:12
anyone that I'm meeting anymore back into like a conversation and that's one of the great skills

Unknown 1:00:45
it's run by Scott logic which Consult

Unknown 1:00:47
a local contractor is kind of weird. Whatever it is they have breakfast

Unknown 1:01:03
I do live in bands. So that's

Unknown 1:01:13
really

Unknown 1:01:20
talking about starting something got you product ideas. Product Backlog. What's your best idea? Not talking what's our main thing right now? We've got the ideas we need to get our textbooks.

Unknown 1:01:41
Yeah you guys are wrestling

Unknown 1:01:52
think you'll find tech companies? I definitely read The Lean Startup.

Unknown 1:01:54
The Y Combinator. Yeah, why not? Yeah. Okay, that's a great thing.

Unknown 1:02:02
They all say the same thing. Build, Build, develop learning feedback loops. First, it's basically thing is with a startup faster you can work out whether you're gonna have traction or not, is launch your first launch. Yeah, exactly, like get something to market see if the problem you're solving is a problem that other people actually want solved. And in a way we can think you know, like it to be solved quicker and cheaper you can get there the better because you might have like 10 Different ideas or you can work out which one's got biggest market traction. So one thing that we're working at the moment is how can we spin out scalable software really quickly so that we can focus on buildings using templates so we can focus on the business logic and take away like the boilerplate that comes with comes with starting up a new bank you make

Unknown 1:03:05
preferring to there's a healthy tension under the assumption that people will like products

Unknown 1:03:33
is thank you

Unknown 1:03:51
like doing so many clients

Unknown 1:03:59
where they'll be like, oh, yeah, I've been thinking about this product. I know exactly what we'll be

Unknown 1:04:11
liable for

Unknown 1:04:20
I know I'm sorry. I know, I'm only on one side so I'm gonna go get another one

Unknown 1:04:32
good. Had a good night. Yes. I wasn't like the watch. Yeah. I always say Are you a fan of uh, no. My dad was. Most definitely. I always say I'm on time.

Unknown 1:05:00
He recognises that sounds cool it's one of these kinds of companies which are vegan energy sustainable windmills solar

Unknown 1:05:54
okay

Unknown 1:05:56
never Expo the trade show our USP is on the first 10 seconds to tell us more so no need no need or looking silly wow that's really cool voice identity nowadays are you doing it right now

Unknown 1:06:37
coming check all the boxes except the transcript generation

Unknown 1:06:49
that's pretty cool

Unknown 1:06:55
I've got no idea something's got my voice from my voice just joined DNA they got all the biometrics going

Unknown 1:07:27
none of this was their biometric data and that's something that we're so far behind we're here in the UK and they're neither wants to either so I guess we're entitled to it

Unknown 1:07:49
yeah I will happily give my data and whoever wants it anyway

Unknown 1:08:14
I mean that place that head of it ahead of it

Unknown 1:08:23
anybody right. So actively looking for that

Unknown 1:08:45
are speaking to MPs and they were getting to

Unknown 1:08:55
know us enjoy like almost like a change of pace Oh

Unknown 1:09:07
depressing flattering to my database.

Unknown 1:09:49
Guys And then what

Unknown 1:10:15
is the sort of phenomenon

Unknown 1:10:26
charity work just like any help

Unknown 1:10:38
just translating LinkedIn I can I can keep you posted on March 2 You never know whether

Unknown 1:11:05
you very much welcome. Yeah, I'm always interested to hear about things like this. This is this is really, really pushing the envelope type stuff, isn't it?

Unknown 1:11:16
There's many channels

Unknown 1:11:26
I've been there for a couple of months. And so I'm still trying to get the labels low, but we are the kind of company who likes to kind of push it with technology like that. Gotcha. So I'll be straight. If there is something that comes up because the sort of thing that we like to do is you know, I mean, you get to give the grants Yeah. Yeah, please do. Please do. Thank you. You're welcome. Nice to meet you. Hello, my mentor. Oh, co founder. No, no, no,

Unknown 1:12:08
I, like I used to study at bar. Oh, do

Unknown 1:12:13
you study? We all do four of us. Oh, you're still involved? Yeah. It's just like part of the course as it were. What do they call it?

Unknown 1:12:27
Unknown non academic service and University. Students can sign up, you sign up, you then go through the programme at the university. Mentors by students, when I run a business, stay in contact with the people that run this mental analysis workshops. And then the investing time had the building dedicated to it. But they've now moved, which is based in city centre, they've now got a new one in the last couple of years. They've allocated space on campus, as much as they used to, there was a lot more like non students innovation stuff. But now, multiple students like myself. Oh, really?

Unknown 1:13:33
Amazing. And so have you ever gone towards this to try and apply it? Yes. Yeah. You've done it for a few months, and you've already got a mentor? Who won't get it. We'll

Unknown 1:13:44
be finishing it in May. Okay.

Unknown 1:13:47
I'm sorry. But how many people you've got working with?

Unknown 1:13:53
We got three others to one was once worked at Intel, like five years ago, was a 29 year old. He I've got two others who just computer science current AI course. And I've got two others outside of the co founder book dropping out as well. For the cause, yeah, right, the journey.

Unknown 1:14:16
If you're achieving things like this now, like imagine what you'll be entitled to five years, 10 years, 15 years, this is fantastic. You deserve the support you get with it. Because it's new, isn't it? It's not like you're taking a pre existing concept and trying to improve it and therefore, taking the SP off the back of that you're, you've thought of something different before or something that doesn't happen yet. And that still adds value. Even though it's probably quite annoying for the people that are gonna get pestered on LinkedIn afterwards. You know, everybody knows there's room

Unknown 1:15:02
to hide my QR code, or I used to cover up a little bit of the barcode so that when they scan didn't work no, I've got no choice. You make it difficult for me to not be justified.

Unknown 1:15:17
You also choose and choose not to connect go here's your choice. You can

Unknown 1:15:21
choose conferences where they kind of have their own one big space like embedded in the ticket you're on the line. And then if you scan the QR code make your LinkedIn absolutely the friends within the conference app okay and then from there you can then say okay, let's take this to the next Oh, sounds like

Unknown 1:15:45
a dating site description

Unknown 1:15:51
websites like that of course I had to try.

Unknown 1:16:21
Right morning

Unknown 1:16:39
model for

Unknown 1:16:48
infrastructure I'd

Unknown 1:16:55
like a sustainable

Unknown 1:16:58
do a venue for themselves and as a beacon energy company basically

Unknown 1:17:22
just build it

Unknown 1:17:29
got coffee machines Whether you're brand new there's like obviously there's lots of student accommodation for me not too fancy to be a barista

Unknown 1:17:47
too many too many TV screen there they're still doing upside as you can see when you come in and work and they're doing well so I think it's owned by the same company obviously some of the opportunities so I think the owner offices are doing crazy there's a lot of space outside they're hoping they would have finished the event that just happened

Unknown 1:18:27
the weather turned on the weather

Unknown 1:18:49
model x

Unknown 1:19:12
we doing

Unknown 1:19:33
one evening places put them in here

Unknown 1:20:14
like I don't know

Unknown 1:20:29
feel free to take any beat you by the way

Unknown 1:20:37
I guess if you're one of the generation where pilots are being put on

Unknown 1:20:58
actually you just need to complete the homework
